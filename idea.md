## 1. Shooting Sensors out of lander at safe height
1st  at 11 km  r = 5km     (area covered - 75km2)
2nd at  7 km  r = 3km     (area covered - ~27 km2)
3rd at  3 km   r  = 1.3km (area covered - ~5 km2)
4th just before touchdown r = 20m (radius covered - ~1.200 km2)

## 2 . Self surveillance
electromyography - for muscles
Heart Rate
recording active/passive time using accelerometer
Blood oxygen sensor
temperature
blood preessure
motion sensors for recording activity

## 3. Disaster management 
warning in case of solar flares and upcoming storms
